## Task Describtion

The task was to create a web application from scratch. The webpage is a portfolio which we can add to as the course progresses.

The portfolio is ment to demonstarte our skills and talents of HTML and CSS to employers that might want to hire someone, with a focus on flexbox, media queries and CSS variables. The portfolio demonstrates the highlights of our work and the process behind it to maximize the chances to find a job. The portfolio is ment to align with certain criteria, mentioned below.

**Note:** As I have only created one webpage so far, this is the only one that is linked and the other containers are filled with placeholder images.

## Actual Behaviour

```
* You are presented with my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

* When you click on the links in the navigation bar, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

* The my-work section includes images of my applications (atm placeholder images) which are titled.

* The first image of the application is larger than the other ones and they all have hover functions.

* When you click on the first/larger image it will take you to the first projects deployed webpage.

* The layout is responsive and adapts to different viewports, such as smartphones and Ipads.
```

## üèÜ Bonus
```

* When you click on the Resume PDF element in the navigation bar, you will download my resume.

* When you click on the GitHub or LinkedIn element in the footer, it will lead you too my profile on both social media websites.
